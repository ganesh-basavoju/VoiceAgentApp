I am attaching a UI reference image.
My existing project is AI Field Notes (Agentic AI system for field voice notes).
I want to completely refactor the UI theme across the entire application to match the look, feel, and visual language of the attached image.

Do NOT change business logic, APIs, or data flow. This is a UI/UX + theming task only.

Design Requirements (Strict)

Global Theme

Adopt a modern purple–violet gradient system similar to the reference image.

Use soft glassmorphism / neumorphism where appropriate (cards, panels).

Backgrounds should use subtle gradients, not flat colors.

Color System

Primary: Deep Purple / Violet

Secondary: Lavender / Soft Lilac

Accent: Neon Purple / Electric Violet

Neutral: Dark Charcoal / Near-black for contrast

Define colors as CSS variables / theme tokens and reuse everywhere.

Typography

Clean, futuristic, readable font (Inter / SF-like).

Strong hierarchy:

Headings → bold, spaced

Body → medium weight

Labels → subtle opacity

Components

Cards: rounded corners, soft glow, gradient borders.

Buttons: gradient fill with hover glow + smooth transitions.

Progress indicators / stats: circular or minimal charts inspired by the reference UI.

Avoid sharp edges, harsh borders, or flat material styles.

Layout & Feel

Mobile-first, but consistent on desktop.

Spacious layout, clear visual breathing room.

Smooth animations (fade, slide, scale) — no over-animation.

Application Scope

Apply theme to:

Login / Auth screens

Dashboard

Field notes recording screens

AI-generated summaries

Admin / project overview pages

Ensure visual consistency across all pages.

Implementation Rules

Centralize theme (ThemeProvider / global CSS / Tailwind config).

No inline random styles.

Refactor existing components to consume the new theme tokens.

Output Expectations

Update global styles/theme config.

Refactor existing components to match the new theme.

Keep the app functional.

Final UI should visually resemble the attached image in mood, polish, and modernity, not pixel-perfect copying.

If any UI conflicts arise, prioritize clarity and usability over decoration.
